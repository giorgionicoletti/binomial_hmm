# Multidimensional binomial HMM
This repo provides an implementation in Python of a trainable Hidden Markov Model optimized for high dimensional spike trains, with independent binomial emissions. The implementation uses Numba to achieve a good performance.

The HMM is trained using a an Expectation-Maximization algorithm.
